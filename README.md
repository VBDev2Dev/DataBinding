# DataBinding

This is a walkthrough on using databinding in winforms and EF.  It will guide you through setting up databinding and entity frameowork to allow data to be read and modified with very little code. See the [tutorial](Tutorial%20Docs/Tutorial.md) to learn how to use databinding and entity framework

## Ideas For Improvement (Checked=Planned to do soon)

- [x] Style row based on if row is selected
- [ ] Let user specify crieteria to only pull down those records
- [ ] Make a Master Detail view of some other data so that you have a ui that shows the master record and the grid shows the detail records of that master record
- [x] Demonstrate deployment using [Wix Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)
